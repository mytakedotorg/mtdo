# U.S. Presidential Debates

## Inclusion criteria
This factset contains every televised United States Presidential Debate. This factset does not currently contain any Vice Presidential Debates, although we plan to add them in the future.

## Notes
The first Presidential Debate took place in 1960 between John Kennedy and Richard Nixon. No one agreed to do them again until 1976, between Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. They have taken place every 4 years since then, up to and including the most recent Presidential Debate in 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. 

When new Presidential Debates take place, we will add them to this factset within twenty-four hours of the completion of the debate.
